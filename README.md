# 🎯 Freshdesk Ticket Parser – Priority Keyword Scanner 🔍

Tired of manually scanning **40–50 Freshdesk tickets** just to figure out which ones are truly urgent?  
This Power Automate Desktop bot does the heavy lifting — **identifying tickets with critical keywords** like “fetal”, “urgent”, “ASAP”, or “current” — so you can focus on what really matters. ⚡

---

## 📌 What Is It?

A smart and simple automation that:
-  Logs into your **Freshdesk dashboard**
-  Loops through all your assigned tickets
-  Scans the **email body** of each ticket for important keywords
-  Extracts and displays:
  -  Ticket ID
  -  Email body
  -  Direct link to the ticket
-  Alerts you **only** when a match is found

No more manual scanning. No more missed tickets. Just results. ✅
